ui_animation.py
---------------
Provides general-purpose animation and tweening helpers for UI elements.

Theoretical Purpose
-------------------
This module defines reusable logic for animating UI properties
such as position, scale, color, or opacity.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Should be abstract and data-driven (interpolate between values).
- Can be used by any UI element (buttons, HUD icons, menus).
- Does not handle input — purely visual animation helpers.

Example Use Cases
-----------------
- Smooth button hover scale or color transitions.
- Sliding panels or fading notifications.
- Tweened text movement or bounce effects.
